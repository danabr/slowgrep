Playing around with Rust's concurrency primitives by implementing a simple grep.

This grep can only handle utf-8 files, and simple string matching (no regexps).
It is also considerably slower than the standard grep program.

The purpose is instead to explore various ways of communicating between tasks
and distributing work load. The common theme is that there are a collection of
worker tasks that "greps" through the files passed to them from one
orchestrating task.

Checkout the branches for various experiments.
